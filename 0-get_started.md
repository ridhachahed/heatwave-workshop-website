# Guide to Setting Up an Oracle Cloud Account for MySQL HeatWave Service

## Overview 

This guide is designed to walk workshop participants through the process of creating an Oracle account, which is the foundational step required to access and utilize the Oracle MySQL HeatWave service. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers a comprehensive cloud computing platform that includes a wide range of services, among which MySQL HeatWave stands out for its advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities.

## Objectives
- Learn the step-by-step process for creating an Oracle account.
- Prepare for the hands-on exploration of MySQL HeatWave service in the workshop.

## Prerequisites 
- A valid email address for account verification.
- A credit card for identity verification purposes (**no charge will be incurred** for the free tier).
- Basic familiarity with cloud services and databases is helpful but not required. 


## Step 1: Sign up for the Free Tier OCI Account

Cloud Free Tier allows you to sign up for an Oracle Cloud account which provides a number of Always Free services and a Free Trial with US$300 of free credit to use on all eligible Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services for up to 30 days. The Always Free services are available for an unlimited period of time. The Free Trial services may be used until your US$300 of free credits are consumed or the 30 days has expired, whichever comes first (see [OCI Free Tier FAQ](https://www.oracle.com/sg/cloud/free/faq/)).

- To sign up for an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account, please, visit [Try MySQL HeatWave](https://www.oracle.com/mysql/free/), and click on *Start for free* on OCI.
